# üõ° Achieving Minimum Viable Security Automation for Web Apps üõ°
### üñã by Cnawel

In today's ever-evolving digital landscape, **üîí security is paramount üîí**. Ensuring the safety of our web applications is not just a best practice; it's a necessity. But where do we start, especially if we're looking for a minimalistic yet effective approach? Allow me to introduce you to *üåü Minimum Viable Security Automation (MVSA) üåü*.

Leveraging the power of Github Actions and scripting, we'll cover a range of fundamental security steps that will fortify your web app's defenses.

## üõ† Security Measures üõ†

### <a name="sast"></a>1Ô∏è‚É£ SAST (Static Application Security Testing)

**Objective**:  
To identify vulnerabilities in the source code prior to deployment, thereby reducing the potential attack surface.

**Description**:  
Static Application Security Testing (SAST) is a white-box testing methodology that analyzes source code for security vulnerabilities. It can identify issues such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and insecure data storage practices. Automation of SAST can be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline, allowing for early detection and remediation of vulnerabilities.

**Tools**:  
- Checkmarx
- Fortify
- Veracode

### <a name="secret"></a>2Ô∏è‚É£ SECRET (Secret Scanning)

**Objective**:  
To detect and protect sensitive information like API keys, passwords, and tokens that may be inadvertently committed to the codebase.

**Description**:  
Secret scanning is an automated process that scans the codebase for hard-coded secrets. It is crucial for preventing accidental exposure of sensitive information. Automated secret scanning can be configured to trigger alerts or even block commits that contain sensitive information.

**Tools**:  
- GitGuardian
- Gitleaks
- TruffleHog

---

### <a name="iac"></a>3Ô∏è‚É£ IAC (Infrastructure as Code)

**Objective**:  
To ensure that infrastructure provisioning scripts are free from misconfigurations and vulnerabilities.

**Description**:  
Infrastructure as Code (IaC) allows for the automated setup, configuration, and management of servers and other infrastructure components. Automated security checks on IaC scripts can identify insecure configurations, such as overly permissive security groups or unencrypted data storage, thereby preventing potential security incidents.

**Tools**:  
- KICS (Keeping Infrastructure as Code Secure)
- Terraform
- Ansible

---

### <a name="sca"></a>4Ô∏è‚É£ SCA (Software Composition Analysis)

**Objective**:  
To identify and remediate vulnerabilities in third-party libraries and dependencies.

**Description**:  
Software Composition Analysis (SCA) is essential for identifying vulnerabilities in open-source libraries and components that your application relies on. Automated SCA can flag out-of-date libraries and suggest updates or patches, thereby reducing the risk associated with third-party code.

**Tools**:  
- Snyk
- WhiteSource
- Black Duck

---

### <a name="containers"></a>5Ô∏è‚É£ CONTAINERS (Container Security)

**Objective**:  
To ensure that containerized applications are secure from both the operating system and application perspectives.

**Description**:  
Container security involves securing the container images, the runtime environment, and the orchestration layer. Automated container scanning can identify vulnerabilities in the images, misconfigurations, and non-compliance with best practices.

**Tools**:  
- Trivy
- Aqua Trivy
- Sysdig

---

### <a name="dast"></a>6Ô∏è‚É£ DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing)

**Objective**:  
To identify vulnerabilities in a running application, simulating how an attacker could exploit them.

**Description**:  
Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) is a black-box testing methodology that identifies vulnerabilities by interacting with a running application. Automated DAST can be configured to run periodically or based on triggers, providing real-time vulnerability assessment.

**Tools**:  
- OWASP ZAP
- Burp Suite
- AppSpider

---

### <a name="mfa"></a>7Ô∏è‚É£ MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)

**Objective**:  
To add an additional layer of security that requires multiple forms of verification before granting access.

**Description**:  
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is a critical security control that requires users to provide two or more verification factors to gain access to a resource. Automating MFA configurations ensures consistent application of security policies across the user base.

**Tools**:  
- Authy
- Google Authenticator
- Duo Security

## <a name="python-app"></a>üêç Python App Considerations üêç
### 8 Things to Keep in Mind with Python Web Apps
1. **Your Code**: Ensure code quality and security.
2. **Your Infra**: Maintain a secure and scalable infrastructure.
3. **Your Runtime**: Optimize the runtime environment.
4. **Your Pipeline**: Secure and streamline your CI/CD pipeline.
5. **Your Data**: Protect sensitive data.
6. **Your 3rd Parties**: Vet and secure third-party services.
7. **Your People**: Train your team on security best practices.

### <a name="additional-functionalities"></a> Pending Additional Functionalities
- **Code Quality Checks**: Integrate SonarQube for code quality assessments.
- **License Compliance**: Utilize FOSSA or Black Duck for license compliance checks.
- **Performance Testing**: Implement Apache JMeter for API performance testing.
- **Backup Artifacts**: Configure a job to backup all generated artifacts to external storage for auditing.
