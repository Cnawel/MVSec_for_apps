# 🛡 Achieving Minimum Viable Security Automation for Web Apps 🛡
### 🖋 by Cnawel

In today's ever-evolving digital landscape, **🔒 security is paramount 🔒**. Ensuring the safety of our web applications is not just a best practice; it's a necessity. But where do we start, especially if we're looking for a minimalistic yet effective approach? Allow me to introduce you to *🌟 Minimum Viable Security Automation (MVSA) 🌟*.

Leveraging the power of Github Actions and scripting, we'll cover a range of fundamental security steps that will fortify your web app's defenses.

## 🛠 Security Measures 🛠

### <a name="sast"></a>1️⃣ SAST (Static Application Security Testing)
Automate the detection of vulnerabilities in your codebase before deployment to ensure a solid foundation for your web app's security.

### <a name="secret"></a>2️⃣ SECRET (Secret Scanning)
Secrets are often the Achilles' heel of web applications. Automate the scanning of your codebase to protect sensitive information.

### <a name="iac"></a>3️⃣ IAC (Infrastructure as Code)
Automate security checks within your Infrastructure as Code (IAC) scripts to prevent misconfigurations and vulnerabilities.

### <a name="sca"></a>4️⃣ SCA (Software Composition Analysis)
Automate the identification and patching of vulnerable third-party libraries and dependencies.

### <a name="containers"></a>5️⃣ CONTAINERS (Container Security)
Automate container security checks to ensure your app is safe from within.

### <a name="dast"></a>6️⃣ DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing)
Automate DAST to catch issues in real-time while your app is running.

### <a name="mfa"></a>7️⃣ MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)
Automate MFA configurations to bolster user account security.

## 🌟 Additional Functionalities 🌟
- **Code Quality Checks**: Integrate SonarQube for code quality assessments.
- **License Compliance**: Utilize FOSSA or Black Duck for license compliance checks.
- **Performance Testing**: Implement Apache JMeter for API performance testing.
- **Backup Artifacts**: Configure a job to backup all generated artifacts to external storage for auditing.
