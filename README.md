## Achieving Minimum Viable Security Automation for Web Apps
### by Cnawel

In today's ever-evolving digital landscape, **security is paramount**. Ensuring the safety of our web applications is not just a best practice; it's a necessity. But where do we start, especially if we're looking for a minimalistic yet effective approach? Allow me to introduce you to *Minimum Viable Security Automation (MVSA)*.

Leveraging the power of Github Actions and scripting, we'll cover a range of fundamental security steps that will fortify your web app's defenses.

1. SAST (Static Application Security Testing):
We begin by exploring Static Application Security Testing. By automating the detection of vulnerabilities in your codebase before deployment, we ensure a solid foundation for your web app's security.

2. SECRET (Secret Scanning):
Secrets are often the Achilles' heel of web applications. Learn how to automate the scanning of your codebase to identify and protect sensitive information from prying eyes.

3. IAC (Infrastructure as Code):
Infrastructure security is a critical component of web app protection. Discover how to automate security checks within your Infrastructure as Code (IAC) scripts to prevent misconfigurations and vulnerabilities.

4. SCA (Software Composition Analysis):
Every web app relies on third-party libraries and dependencies. Automate the process of identifying and patching vulnerable components to reduce attack surface.

5. CONTAINERS (Container Security):
Containerization is a game-changer, but it comes with its own set of security challenges. Discover how to automate container security checks to ensure your app is safe from within.

6. DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing):
Dynamic Application Security Testing allows you to identify vulnerabilities while your app is running. Learn how to automate DAST to catch issues in real-time.

7. MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication):
Lastly, we delve into the world of Multi-Factor Authentication, a vital defense layer for web applications. Automate MFA configurations to bolster user account security.

Join me on this journey to secure your web apps, one automated step at a time. Security doesn't have to be overwhelming; with MVSA, it can be both effective and manageable.
